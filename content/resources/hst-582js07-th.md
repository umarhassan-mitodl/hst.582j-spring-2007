  caption: 'From a former student: "I liked this class so much that I was overjoyed
    to find out that I would need a CT scan when I broke my arm. Fortunately, they
    gave me the raw data on a CD in the form of 2D slices. So I quickly searched for
    my Lab 3 and processed it into a 3D model in MATLAB. It came out pretty well!"
